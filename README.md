# Adam H. Sparks' Academic CV

Full CV - [Adam H. Sparks CV](docs/Adam_H_Sparks_CV.pdf)

My CV is based on JooYoung Seo's Academic CV, <https://github.com/jooyoungseo/jy_CV>, which is based on the vitae package with modifications.

I have modified the colours and sections to suit myself and use CSV files in lieu of XLSX to track changes in Git. 

I also added a modification to add line-breaks to long URLs, see https://github.com/adamhsparks/AHSparks_CV/blob/bdbcb610bd063f73d470457ad1d906c4c1e39151/awesome-cv.cls#L93.

Otherwise, see his CV for a full list of changes from the vitae package defaults.
