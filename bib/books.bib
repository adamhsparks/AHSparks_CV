  abstract  = {This chapter reviews approaches taken to assessing the impact of diseases on rice crops, primarily in tropical Asia, compared with insect pests and weeds. Published estimates of yield loss show great variation between and within reports. This reflects the diversity of metrics used and differences in method, location, scale, crop ecosystem etc., exposing the inconsistency of the estimates as representative of rice production. Results are then summarised of >1000 surveys of farmers' fields conducted over 25Â years to a standardised protocol. Estimates were made of the levels of injury to the growing crop attributed to each disease or pest species present, and of the crop yield. Records of physical, biological, and socio-economic characteristics showed the importance of the influence of the crop's ``production situation'' on the impact of pathogen and pest species. These surveys were complemented by the results of yield-loss experiments, and by epidemic modelling (based on EPIRICE) and yield-loss modelling (based on RICEPEST). An overview of the results of this research programme is presented, together with a summary of recent trends in rice crop health in Asia. In contrast with views widely held in the 1980s, plant diseases now appear to have a much greater impact on rice production than insect pests.},
