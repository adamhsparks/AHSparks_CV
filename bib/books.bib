  abstract  = {This chapter reviews approaches taken to assessing the impact of diseases on rice crops, primarily in tropical Asia, compared with insect pests and weeds. Published estimates of yield loss show great variation between and within reports. This reflects the diversity of metrics used and differences in method, location, scale, crop ecosystem etc., exposing the inconsistency of the estimates as representative of rice production. Results are then summarised of >1000 surveys of farmers' fields conducted over 25Â years to a standardised protocol. Estimates were made of the levels of injury to the growing crop attributed to each disease or pest species present, and of the crop yield. Records of physical, biological, and socio-economic characteristics showed the importance of the influence of the crop's ``production situation'' on the impact of pathogen and pest species. These surveys were complemented by the results of yield-loss experiments, and by epidemic modelling (based on EPIRICE) and yield-loss modelling (based on RICEPEST). An overview of the results of this research programme is presented, together with a summary of recent trends in rice crop health in Asia. In contrast with views widely held in the 1980s, plant diseases now appear to have a much greater impact on rice production than insect pests.},

  abstract  = {The response of plant disease to weather variables such as temperature and precipitation is well known and has been the basis for disease forecasting models used in decision-making by farmers and policy makers. Thus, plant disease risk can readily shift under climate change. Predicting changes in risk under climate change is complicated by the many biological interactions that result in disease. For example, some plant diseases occur when the phenology of plant and pathogen are aligned, in the case of Fusarium head blight so that spores are ready to infect during wheat flowering. There are numerous examples of experiments involving simulated climate change that have shown changes in disease risk. Finding indicators of climate change effects on disease in real agricultural or natural systems is more challenging, because of the correlative nature of the observations and the potential for many other factors to influence disease, such as changes in host abundance. Assessments of global disease databases suggest some pathogen range shifts consistent with predicted outcomes for climate change. There are also several cases of emerging tree diseases in which climate change has likely played a role.},
